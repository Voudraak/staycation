<p> FAQ'S - </p>

<p>Is my holiday protected? </p>
<p> You can rest assured knowing that your holiday is fully covered through our ATOL protection scheme. But Staycation go one step further. Whether you book your whole holiday or just accommodation through On the Beach, every part of your holiday is financially protected through our UK trust account, meaning we cannot access money paid for a holiday until the date of travel. </p>
<p>We were really proud to be the first UK online travel agent to put this trust account system in place and we have been paying all our hotels and transfers in this way since 2011. </p>
<p>This means that in the unlikely event that if we or one of our suppliers experiences financial failure, customers won’t lose money paid for a holiday. </p>

<p>Where do you recommended that I go on holiday this season?</p>
<p>Staycation offer an extensive range of holidays – all of which can be found on our website. You can search to find a holiday that suits you by using the search bar. </p>
